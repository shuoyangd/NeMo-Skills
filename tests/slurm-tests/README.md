# Slurm tests

To add a new Slurm test follow this process:
1. Create a new folder with the descriptive name for the test.
2. Add a run_test.py that will launch the main test jobs. Can run arbitrary pipelines here.
3. Add a check_results.py that will operate on the output of run_test.py and do quality checks. E.g. can check benchmark accuracy range or the presence of certain files, etc.
4. Update run_test.py to schedule check_results.py as the final job.
5. Add your new test into [./run_all.sh](./run_all.sh)

You can always run tests manually from any branch by running

```bash
./run_all.sh <cluster name>
```

You can change CURRENT_DATE to any value there to ensure you don't
accidentally override results of existing pipeline.

See [./clone_and_run.sh](./clone_and_run.sh) for how to register tests to run on schedule with cron.
